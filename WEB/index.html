       <P>So it started us a normal day until i went online and saw a message in the class group.
        I haven't been online for like 3 weeks and thought the teachers were still on strike. I saw the message then released i have missed a lot but still we move.
        So last week thursday i came to class and saw what they had done and had to sit up and learn. I started with freecode camp and it was okay until i got to some part of it. I actually started laughing and was wondering what to do. i went on youtube and saw some videos and completed one project to submit. I thought the submission would be the easy part but no! no! No!
        That was the worst.
